# BMP Steganography

Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another message or physical object to avoid detection. Steganography can be used to hide virtually any type of digital content, including text, image, video, or audio content. 

This program allows you to do two things: encode a 'secret image' within a regular image and then subsequently decode a hidden image from an encoded image. This is achieved through bit swapping of the pixels for the three primary colors red, green, and blue (RGB). 

This program was written entirely in C using C standard libraries.
